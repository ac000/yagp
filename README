		yagp - Yet Another Gallery Program

This is inspired by the gThumb web gallery creator. It has very simple
requirements, GraphicsMagick & libexif.

Building it is as simple as typing make.

To run it, simply cd into the directory containing the images you wish to
use for the gallery and run yagp -t "My Album", or whatever title you want.

It will create three directories; html, thumbnails & previews. Copy the theme
directory from this repository into the html directory so you end up with
html/theme
