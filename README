		yagp - Yet Another Gallery Program

This is inspired by the gThumb web gallery creator. It has very simple
requirements, GraphicsMagick & libexif.

Building it is as simple as typing make.

To run it, simply cd into the directory containing the images you wish to
use for the gallery and run yagp -t "My Album", or whatever title you want.

It will create three directories; html, thumbnails & previews. Copy the theme
directory from this repository into the html directory so you end up with
html/theme

By default yagp will create a 4x4 grid of images per page. You can use the
-p and -r options to set the number of images per page and number of images
per row respectively. Note: images per page should be wholly divisible by
images per row. e.g the defaults is equivalent to specifying -p 16 -r 4

By default images will be processed in name order, you can use the -s switch
to sort by mtime with -s mtime.
